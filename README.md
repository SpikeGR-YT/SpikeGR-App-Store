# SpikeGR - App Store

This is the Official GitHub Repository for the SpikeGR App Store.


# What is the SpikeGR App Store?

SpikeGR App Store contains all the programs and scripts created by SpikeGR, all in one place!

## How to Update the SpikeGR App Store to the latest version?

Simply launch the App Store and there will be a popup saying that an update is available.

## Things to note:

 - Keep in mind this is just a Pre-Alpha version, it was released to the public so that the developer can fix bugs, issues etc.
 
 - .NET Framework 4.8.1 Runtime is required in order to run SpikeGR App Store.

 - All programs and scripts inside the SpikeGR App Store are all open source on the dev's GitHub page, but the App Store itself is not open source. We do not have plans to make it open source for now.
